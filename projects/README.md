Here are a few research projects that are built on detectron2.
They are examples of how to use detectron2 as a library, to make your projects more
maintainable.

Note that these are research projects, and therefore may not have the same level
of support or stability of detectron2.

+ [DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild](DensePose)
+ [Scale-Aware Trident Networks for Object Detection](TridentNet)
+ [TensorMask: A Foundation for Dense Object Segmentation](TensorMask)
+ Mesh R-CNN (Coming Soon)
+ PointRend: Image Segmentation as Rendering (Coming Soon)
