# Use Models

Models (and their sub-models) in detectron2 are built by
functions such as `build_model`, `build_backbone`, `build_roi_heads`:
```python
from detectron2.modeling import build_model
model = build_model(cfg)  # returns a torch.nn.Module
```

To load an existing checkpoint to the model, use
`DetectionCheckpointer(model).load(file_path)`.
Detectron2 recognizes models in pytorch's `.pth` format, as well as the `.pkl` files
in our model zoo.

You can use a model by just `outputs = model(inputs)`.
Next, we explain the inputs/outputs format used by the builtin models in detectron2.


### Model Input Format

All builtin models take a `list[dict]` as the inputs. Each dict
corresponds to information about one image.

The dict may contain the following keys:

* "image": `Tensor` in (C, H, W) format. The meaning of channels are defined by `cfg.INPUT.FORMAT`.
* "instances": an [Instances](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Instances)
	object, with the following fields:
	+ "gt_boxes": a [Boxes](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Boxes) object storing N boxes, one for each instance.
	+ "gt_classes": `Tensor` of long type, a vector of N labels, in range [0, num_categories).
	+ "gt_masks": a [PolygonMasks](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.PolygonMasks)
	  or [BitMasks](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.BitMasks) object storing N masks, one for each instance.
	+ "gt_keypoints": a [Keypoints](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Keypoints)
	  object storing N keypoint sets, one for each instance.
* "proposals": an [Instances](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Instances)
	object used in Fast R-CNN style models, with the following fields:
	+ "proposal_boxes": a [Boxes](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Boxes) object storing P proposal boxes.
	+ "objectness_logits": `Tensor`, a vector of P scores, one for each proposal.
* "height", "width": the **desired** output height and width of the image, not necessarily the same
	as the height or width of the `image` when input into the model, which might be after resizing.
	For example, it can be the **original** image height and width before resizing.

	If provided, the model will produce output in this resolution,
	rather than in the resolution of the `image` as input into the model. This is more efficient and accurate.
* "sem_seg": `Tensor[int]` in (H, W) format. The semantic segmentation ground truth.
  Values represent category labels starting from 0.


#### How it connects to data loader:

The output of the default [DatasetMapper]( ../modules/data.html#detectron2.data.DatasetMapper) is a dict
that follows the above format.
After the data loader performs batching, it becomes `list[dict]` which the builtin models support.


### Model Output Format

When in training mode, the builtin models output a `dict[str->ScalarTensor]` with all the losses.

When in inference mode, the builtin models output a `list[dict]`, one dict for each image. Each dict may contain:

* "instances": [Instances](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Instances)
  object with the following fields:
	* "pred_boxes": [Boxes](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Boxes) object storing N boxes, one for each detected instance.
	* "scores": `Tensor`, a vector of N scores.
	* "pred_classes": `Tensor`, a vector of N labels in range [0, num_categories).
	+ "pred_masks": a `Tensor` of shape (N, H, W), masks for each detected instance.
	+ "pred_keypoints": a `Tensor` of shape (N, num_keypoint, 3).
		Each row in the last dimension is (x, y, score). Scores are larger than 0.
* "sem_seg": `Tensor` of (num_categories, H, W), the semantic segmentation prediction.
* "proposals": [Instances](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Instances)
	object with the following fields:
	* "proposal_boxes": [Boxes](../modules/structures.html#detectron2.structures.Boxes)
		object storing N boxes.
	* "objectness_logits": a torch vector of N scores.
* "panoptic_seg": A tuple of `(Tensor, list[dict])`. The tensor has shape (H, W), where each element
	represent the segment id of the pixel. Each dict describes one segment id and has the following fields:
	* "id": the segment id
	* "isthing": whether the segment is a thing or stuff
	* "category_id": the category id of this segment. It represents the thing
       class id when `isthing==True`, and the stuff class id otherwise.


### How to use a model in your code:

Contruct your own `list[dict]`, with the necessary keys.
For example, for inference, provide dicts with "image", and optionally "height" and "width".

Note that when in training mode, all models are required to be used under an `EventStorage`.
The training statistics will be put into the storage:
```python
from detectron2.utils.events import EventStorage
with EventStorage() as storage:
  losses = model(inputs)
```
